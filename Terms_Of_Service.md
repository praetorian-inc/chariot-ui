# Terms of Service

### Effective date: July 2, 2024

These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) apply to your use of some or all of the Security-As-A-Service platform, including, without limitation, its domain and sub-domains, administrator manuals, documentation, vulnerability datasets and meta-data, machine learning training sets, knowledge bases, brain trust, and professional service advice (collectively, the “Platform”), as well as your use of free-trial products that we may provide you from time to time (the Platform and such free-trial products, collectively, the “Services”).

THIS IS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU REPRESENT (“you,” “your,” or “Customer”), TO INCLUDE ALL INDIVIDUALS YOU AUTHORIZE TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT (“User(s)”), and Praetorian Security, Inc. (“Praetorian,” “we,” or “us”) governing your use of the Services.

By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. You must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to accept these Terms. If you do not agree to the terms or are not of legal age in your jurisdiction of residence, do not use the Services. By using the Services, you represent that you agree to the terms and are of legal age. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, such as the company you work for, then you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such entity to these Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not have such authority or if you do not agree to these Terms.

## Modification to the Services and these Terms

Because the Services is an evolving service, we may, in our sole discretion, update these Terms from time to time. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to give you notice of any material changes to these Terms. Any changes to these Terms will be effective on the “Last Revised” date set forth above and your continued use of the Services will constitute your agreement to such changes.

## Freemium Support of the Services

You acknowledge that the Freemium Edition is a free service offered by Praetorian and that the Freemium Edition does not include any official support program provided by Praetorian. Praetorian may, at its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your Freemium subscription or stop offering the Freemium Edition altogether, in either case with or without notice to you.

## Paid Subscription

If you choose a paid-subscription plan, you agree to pay us fees in accordance with the relevant pricing plan. The fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in these Terms.

If you move to a higher tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect immediately, and we will charge you for the additional fees associated with the new paid plan on a pro-rata basis. If you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect in the next billing cycle. You acknowledge that you will not receive a refund for the then-current billing cycle if you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, or to a non-payment subscription plan.

We reserve the right not to provide you with access to the Services or any of the associated services until the relevant fee is paid in full and the payment processing is complete.

We also reserve the right to change our fees or payment plans at any time. By continuing to use the Services, after the date the new fee or payment plan becomes effective), you agree to be bound by the changes to the Terms, and your next billing statement will include the new fees on a pro rata basis.

If you do not agree to such change(s), within 30 days of the date on which the new fee or payment plan becomes effective, you must: (1) notify Praetorian via email to support@praetorian.com of your intention to terminate these Terms, (2) ask that your account be deleted, and (3) stop using the Services. In your final billing statement, the charges will be limited to the period prior to termination and will be based on the fee or payment plan in place prior to the institution of the new fee or payment plan.

You will pay fees without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind, except as may be required by law. If any withholding or deduction is required by law, you will, when making the payment to which the withholding or deduction relates, pay to us such additional amount as will ensure that we receive the same total amount that we would have received if no such withholding or deduction had been required.

## Your Obligations and Restrictions

## Accessing the Services

While we will make reasonable efforts to ensure the Services are operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, we do not guarantee that the Services will always be available or be uninterrupted. In particular, but without limitation:

We will not be liable to you if the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period due to an event or cause outside of our control.

## Rights We Grant You

We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to make use of the Services solely for your internal business operations and in accordance with these Terms.

These Terms do not convey any rights of ownership in the Services. You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Services anywhere in the world belong to us or our licensors (even after installation onto a computer owned by you or integration into your system), and that you have no rights in or to the Services other than those right to use the Services explicitly granted in accordance with these Terms. Praetorian owns all intellectual property rights in and relation to the Services as well as any content or services provided thereunder. Praetorian reserves all other rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

In the event that you breach the terms of the license granted to you herein and such breach results in the creation of derivative works of the Services (“Improvements”), you hereby assign with full title guarantee all such Improvements to us. Such assignment does not preclude us from taking any legal or other action against you for contravention of these Terms, including for infringement of our intellectual property rights.

You may from time-to-time provide suggestions, comments, ideas or other feedback (“Feedback”) to us with respect to the Services. To the extent that you provide such Feedback, you grant us an unlimited right and license to use, disclose, reproduce, sub-license or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback as we see fit, entirely without obligation or payment to you or restriction of any kind.

## Rights You Grant Us

We claim no intellectual property rights in and to your applications, code, infrastructure, project, or any material you provide or otherwise transmit to us via the Services.

However, to enable your use of the Services, we do need to inspect portions of your project and send parts of it to our servers. This information includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the project, information relating to your application’s code, dependencies, components, and infrastructure, and how each are being used, aggregated, and correlated (“Project Information”). For these purposes, we require, and you hereby grant us, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, use, reproduce, display, and transmit the Project Information and any other materials transmitted to us via the Services to the extent necessary to enable your use of the Services, including monitoring services. This license shall remain in effect until and unless these Terms are terminated.

In addition to the rights granted to us above, we also require, and you hereby grant to us, a license to store, use, reproduce, display, and transmit the Project Information and any other materials transmitted via the Services for analytical purposes and to improve our Services. This license shall remain in effect unless and until you email us at support@praetorian.com and expressly ask us to delete such data from our database. For the avoidance of doubt, this license will not automatically end upon termination of these Terms or the Services.

## Machine Learning Usage & Data Analysis

Our Services reports to us vulnerability instances discovered, using meta-data that includes, but is not limited to, vulnerable source code, source code derivatives (e.g., patches), build data, configurations, contributors, control-flow, data-flow, dependencies, end-points, filenames, run-time execution, users, and version information. This anonymized vulnerability information will only be used by us for analytical purposes to improve the accuracy of the Services in predicting a valid vulnerability. This data analysis informs our product development decisions on how to improve the confidence that a vulnerability exists or does not exist. As a User, you can opt out of this feature by disabling ‘Advanced Analytics’ found under the configuration settings.

## Trademark

These Terms do not grant any right or license to use Praetorian’s names, logos, symbols, and/or any other Praetorian trademarks.
