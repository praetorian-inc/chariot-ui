## Description

Chariot is an expert-driven, all-in-one offensive security platform that helps organizations shift from a reactive "assume breach" mentality to a prevention-first strategy. By actively seeking out vulnerabilities and addressing potential weaknesses before attackers can exploit them, Chariot ensures a robust security posture through continuous offensive security testing. 


## Key Features

- **Attack Surface Management**: Continuously monitor all attack vectors including external, internal, cloud, web app, secrets, phishing, rogue IT, and supplier/vendor risk.
- **Continuous Penetration Testing**: Perform strategic, adversarial-focused assessments to identify critical issues.
- **Continuous Red Teaming**: Test your cybersecurity programâ€™s resilience over time.
- **Breach & Attack Simulation**: Simulate known exploitations to identify gaps in prevention and detection plans.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.14.0)
- npm (10.7.0)
- `mkcert` (for creating local HTTPS certificates)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/praetorian-inc/chariot-ui.git
   cd chariot-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up HTTPS certificates using `mkcert`:

   ```sh
   mkdir certs && cd certs
   npx mkcert create-ca
   npx mkcert create-cert
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the app on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

### Building the Project

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build` directory.
